                    <h2>My introduction</h2>
                    <p>Born and brought up in the city of Lucknow, I completed my secondary education in 2015 from Sherwood Academy (ICSE board), and higher secondary education in 2017 from City Montessori School(ISC) scoring 75% with Computer Science as one of my major subjects. By the time I had completed higher secondary education, I had already gained beginner level coding skills and became fluent in basic coding languages like C++ and JAVA, during higher secondary education.

                     Following my dedication and achieving decent grades in Computer Science being a motivator, I went on to pursue Bachelors in Computer Applications from Galgotias University, and it was during my bachelors that I was able to figure out my passion for web development among other branches or domains in Computer Science. As part of my Bachelors curriculum, I was introduced to basic web development which really increased my inclination towards it.</p>

                    <h2>How I got into web dev & My future plans</h2>
                    <p>
                     Being born in the era of the internet, the exposure to computers & web surfing commenced at an early age for me, visiting several sites daily whether its education, sports or entertainment related. Like any curious kid,I had a multitude of questions in mind like - how do these websites actually work? How are they built? How do browsers, computers, and mobile devices interact with the web? What skills are necessary to build a website? The answer to all these questions resulted in me taking up computer science as a subject in school from standard 5 onwards. But I actually started taking keen interest in the computer science field when I was in pre-high school and had just been introduced to programming and one of the major reasons I really enjoyed programming was because it is based completely on logic. Scoring well in secondary and higher secondary standards in programming motivated me to pursue it as a career.

                    <img id="imgS" src="./images/blogImg2.jpeg" alt=""><p>I aspire to be a Full-Stack Web Developer who can adapt and stay on top of emerging technologies and engineering trends. Full-Stack Web Developers are the multi-talented professionals that every company and brand needs to succeed. By exploring this field, I would like to know how things work on a big scale at industry level gaining crucial knowledge about the technical know-how, which would further help me achieve my long term goal.

                    Lucknow, my hometown, has a rich culture and is known for its art and craftsmanship. Many small companies and craftsmen, particularly in rural regions, devote thousands of hours in creating beautiful work but are unable to realize the true value of their work owing to a lack of expertise and access to the internet and developing technologies in this digital age. Given India's tremendous push toward "Digital India," I believe I can make a significant contribution by providing a means to these artisans. I wish to aid them in marketing their work on a national and global level and realizing the true value of their craftsmanship. I want to build a website that will allow them to host the work of various small companies and craftsmen from rural and urban
